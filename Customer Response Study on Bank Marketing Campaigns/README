A bank conducted a campaign to increase the conversion ratio of one of their products i.e. “Personal Loans” and the details for customers were collated. The campaign targeted 
the customers with an offer of Personal Loan at 10% interest rate per annum and in this project we created Clustering, CART, Random Forest and ANN models to understand the 
customer behavior with respect to such marketing campaigns and also predict the probable customer response if another campaign like such is organized.
